Unlocking Loan Default Insights with Data Science & LightGBM
🚀 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering for Loan Default Prediction 🔍
Understanding loan default risk is crucial for financial decision-making, and data science provides powerful tools to uncover hidden patterns. I recently conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering on a loan dataset, achieving an accuracy of 94.7% using LightGBM. Here are the key takeaways:

🔹 Key Insights from EDA:
📌 Loan Intent Trends: Education, medical, and venture loans are the most common, while home improvement loans are the least frequent.
📌 Risky Loan Grades: Grades A & B dominate, but Grade D has the highest default rate.
📌 Home Ownership & Borrowers: 51.6% rent, while 41.9% have a mortgage.
📌 Age & Credit History: Ages range from 20 to 123 years (outliers detected). Credit histories span 2 to 30 years, with longer histories suggesting financial stability.
📌 Loan Amounts & Employment Length: Loan amounts vary from $500 to $35,000. Employment length has extreme values (e.g., 123 years), highlighting potential data errors.
📌 Income & Loan Status: Income strongly correlates with loan status. High-income borrowers default too, but age does not show a direct pattern.
📌 Credit File Defaults: Borrowers with past defaults are more likely to default again.
🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps:
✅ Handled missing values in employment length & interest rates.
✅ Removed duplicate records to ensure unbiased modeling.
✅ Identified & treated outliers in income, age, and employment length.
✅ Transformed skewed data for better model performance.
✅ Scaled numerical features for consistent machine learning input.
✅ Encoded categorical variables like loan intent, home ownership, and loan grade.
🔹 Feature Engineering for Better Predictions:
To enhance model performance, I engineered new features: 🔹 Income Percentile: Measures income standing relative to others.
🔹 Income to Credit History Ratio: Evaluates financial stability.
🔹 Estimated Annual Income: Adjusted for hypothetical growth.
🔹 Median Income per Employment Group: Provides contextual insights.
🔹 Employment Length Categories: Groups employment length intuitively.
🔹 Model Performance with LightGBM:
💡 LightGBM achieved an impressive 94.7% accuracy, demonstrating the power of careful data preprocessing and feature engineering. 🚀
📊 Next Steps: Further optimization using hyperparameter tuning & interpretability techniques like SHAP.
